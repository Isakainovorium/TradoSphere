# MCP Tools Setup - Next Steps

## ‚úÖ What's Already Done

- ‚úÖ Claude Desktop config directory created: `~/.config/Claude/`
- ‚úÖ Configuration file copied: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- ‚úÖ Correct paths set for TradoSphere Context Engine
- ‚úÖ All 5 Week 1 tools configured

## üîë Step 1: Get API Keys (5-10 minutes)

You need to obtain 2 API keys and add them to the config file.

### GitHub Personal Access Token (Required)

**Why needed:** Allows Claude to manage branches, PRs, issues, and commits in your repository.

**How to get it:**

1. **Visit:** https://github.com/settings/tokens

2. **Click:** "Generate new token (classic)"

3. **Token description:** Enter something like "Claude Desktop MCP - TradoSphere"

4. **Select scopes (important!):**
   - ‚úÖ `repo` - Full control of private repositories
   - ‚úÖ `read:org` - Read org and team membership
   - ‚úÖ `workflow` - Update GitHub Action workflows

5. **Click:** "Generate token" at the bottom

6. **Copy the token** - It starts with `ghp_` and you'll only see it once!

7. **Update the config:**
   ```bash
   nano ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

   Find this line:
   ```json
   "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "ghp_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
   ```

   Replace `ghp_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` with your actual token:
   ```json
   "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "ghp_YourActualToken1234567890abcdef"
   ```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note:**
- Never commit this token to git
- Keep it secure
- If compromised, revoke it immediately on GitHub and generate a new one

---

### Exa API Key (Optional but Recommended)

**Why needed:** Enables AI-powered web search to find production code patterns and solutions.

**How to get it:**

1. **Visit:** https://exa.ai/

2. **Sign up** for an account (free tier available)

3. **Navigate to:** API settings or Dashboard

4. **Generate** an API key

5. **Copy the key**

6. **Update the config:**
   ```bash
   nano ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

   Find this line:
   ```json
   "EXA_API_KEY": "YOUR_EXA_API_KEY_HERE"
   ```

   Replace with your actual key:
   ```json
   "EXA_API_KEY": "your-actual-exa-key-here"
   ```

**Skip for now?** If you want to start with just 4 tools, you can comment out or remove the entire `exa` section from the config.

---

## üîÑ Step 2: Restart Claude Desktop

After adding your API keys to the config:

1. **Quit Claude Desktop completely**
   - Don't just close the window
   - Ensure the application is fully terminated

2. **Relaunch Claude Desktop**
   - The MCP servers will initialize on startup

3. **Look for confirmation**
   - You may see a notification or indicator showing MCP servers are connected
   - Check for tool icons or an MCP status indicator

---

## ‚úÖ Step 3: Run Verification Tests

Once Claude Desktop is restarted, test each tool to ensure it's working:

### Test 1: TradoSphere Context Engine
**Purpose:** Verify codebase search works

**Try these queries in Claude Desktop:**
```
"Search docs for authentication flow"
"Find route for leaderboard feature"
"Get stats on indexed documents"
"List all features related to competitions"
```

**Expected result:**
- Returns information from the 346 indexed TradoSphere documentation files
- Shows relevant sections, routes, and code references

---

### Test 2: Memory (Knowledge Persistence)
**Purpose:** Verify context storage works

**Store something:**
```
"Store this architectural decision: We're using Jotai for state management
because it provides atomic updates needed for the /live page with 12+
synchronized UI elements. Benchmarks showed 40% fewer re-renders compared
to Zustand."
```

**Then retrieve it:**
```
"What was our decision about state management and why?"
```

**Expected result:**
- First query confirms information stored
- Second query accurately retrieves the stored context

---

### Test 3: GitHub (Repository Management)
**Purpose:** Verify GitHub integration works

**Try these queries:**
```
"Show me the current branch and status"
"List all open PRs in the TradoSphere repo"
"Show recent commits on main branch"
```

**Expected result:**
- Returns actual data from your GitHub repository
- If authentication fails, double-check your token has the correct scopes

**Note:** First use may take a few seconds as npx downloads the package.

---

### Test 4: Exa (Technical Research)
**Purpose:** Verify web search works

**Try these queries:**
```
"Find Next.js 14 + WebSocket state management patterns"
"Search for Agora.io + React hooks implementation examples"
"Locate real-time leaderboard implementations with low latency"
```

**Expected result:**
- Returns relevant articles, code examples, and resources from the web
- Results should be technical and production-focused

**Note:** Each search counts against your Exa API quota.

**If you skipped Exa:** That's fine! The other 4 tools will still work.

---

### Test 5: Sequential Thinking
**Purpose:** Verify feature decomposition works

**Try these queries:**
```
"Decompose the live streaming feature into sequential implementation steps"
"Break down signal posting with AI parsing into a step-by-step plan"
"Plan the competition scoring system implementation"
```

**Expected result:**
- Returns numbered, sequential steps
- Shows clear dependencies and implementation order
- Includes considerations for edge cases and testing

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

You've successfully set up the MCP tools if:

- ‚úÖ All 5 verification tests pass (or 4 if you skipped Exa)
- ‚úÖ TradoSphere Context returns actual documentation content
- ‚úÖ Memory can store and retrieve information
- ‚úÖ GitHub shows your actual repository data
- ‚úÖ Exa returns web search results (if configured)
- ‚úÖ Sequential Thinking returns logical step-by-step plans

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue: Tools not showing up in Claude Desktop

**Possible causes:**
1. Config file has JSON syntax errors
2. File is in wrong location
3. Claude Desktop not fully restarted

**Solutions:**
1. Validate JSON syntax:
   ```bash
   python3 -m json.tool ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

2. Verify file location:
   ```bash
   ls -la ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

3. Check Claude Desktop logs (if accessible)

---

### Issue: TradoSphere Context fails to start

**Error:** "Cannot find module" or "Server failed to start"

**Solutions:**
1. Verify the path is correct:
   ```bash
   ls -la /home/user/TradoSphere/tools/mcp-servers/tradosphere-context/dist/mcp/server.js
   ```

2. Check node_modules exists:
   ```bash
   ls -la /home/user/TradoSphere/tools/mcp-servers/tradosphere-context/node_modules
   ```

3. Ensure Node.js is accessible:
   ```bash
   which node
   node --version
   ```

---

### Issue: GitHub authentication fails

**Error:** "401 Unauthorized" or "Invalid token"

**Solutions:**
1. Regenerate token with correct scopes (`repo`, `read:org`, `workflow`)
2. Ensure no extra spaces in the config
3. Verify token format starts with `ghp_`
4. Check token hasn't expired

---

### Issue: Exa returns errors

**Error:** "API key invalid" or "Quota exceeded"

**Solutions:**
1. Verify API key has no extra spaces
2. Check Exa account status at https://exa.ai/
3. Confirm you haven't exceeded free tier limits
4. Try regenerating the API key

---

### Issue: NPX commands are slow

**Observation:** First use of GitHub/Exa/Sequential Thinking takes 5-10 seconds

**Explanation:** This is normal! `npx` downloads packages on first use, then caches them.

**Not an issue:** Subsequent uses will be instant (< 1 second).
