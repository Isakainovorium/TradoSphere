---

## 🗺️ Development Workflow Map

### **Phase 1: Feature Planning (Use Claude Desktop)**

**When to use Desktop:**
- Before starting any feature > 8 hours of work
- Before architectural decisions
- When researching implementation patterns
- When uncertain about approach

**Desktop Workflow:**
```
1. Search Context Engine
   "Search TradoSphere docs for similar features to [new feature]"

2. Research Patterns (Exa)
   "Find production implementations of [specific pattern]"

3. Decompose Feature (Sequential Thinking)
   "Break down [feature name] into implementation steps considering
    TradoSphere's tech stack: Next.js 14, NestJS, Supabase, Gemini 2.0"

4. Store Decision (Memory)
   "Store architectural decision: For [feature], we're using [approach]
    because [reasoning]. Alternatives considered: [options]. Trade-offs: [analysis]"
```

**Output:** Detailed implementation plan with steps, considerations, and decisions stored

---

### **Phase 2: Implementation (Use Claude Code)**

**Switch to Claude Code for:**
- All actual coding
- File creation/editing
- Running tests
- Git operations
- Database operations

**Claude Code Workflow:**
```
You: "Implement [feature] based on the plan we created in Desktop.
      Here are the key architectural decisions: [paste from Desktop Memory]"

Claude Code:
- Creates all necessary files
- Implements components, APIs, database changes
- Writes tests
- Runs build to verify
- Commits with clear messages
```

**Checkpoints:** See Phase 3 below

---

### **Phase 3: Validation Checkpoints (Critical!)**

**Checkpoint Frequency:**
- ✅ After every major component (every 2-4 hours of work)
- ✅ Before committing complex changes
- ✅ After integrating multiple systems
- ✅ Before database migrations
- ✅ After security-related code

**What to Validate:**

**Checkpoint Template:**
```
Claude Code creates implementation → You review:

1. Does it match the architectural plan?
2. Are edge cases handled?
3. Is error handling comprehensive?
4. Are types correct (TypeScript)?
5. Is it secure (no SQL injection, XSS, etc.)?
6. Does it follow TradoSphere conventions?
7. Are tests comprehensive?
```

**How to Checkpoint:**
```
You: "Show me what you've implemented so far for [component]"
Claude Code: [Shows code summary]
You: [Review and provide feedback]
You: "This looks good, but also handle the case where [edge case]"
Claude Code: [Updates implementation]
```

## 🚨 High-Risk Areas Requiring Extra Context

These areas need **mandatory checkpoints** and often **Desktop planning**:

### **1. Security-Critical Code** 🔒

**Areas:**
- Authentication flows
- Authorization checks
- Payment processing
- API key handling
- Database RLS policies

**Workflow:**
```
Desktop: Research security patterns for [specific area]
Claude Code: Implement with security best practices
✅ MANDATORY CHECKPOINT: Security review
You: Verify no SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.
Claude Code: Add missing security measures
✅ SECOND CHECKPOINT: Final security validation
```

**Why:** Security bugs are costly, better to validate early

---

### **2. Performance-Critical Code** ⚡

**Areas:**
- Leaderboard queries (1000+ participants)
- Feed pagination (10K+ signals)
- Real-time updates (WebSocket/Socket.io)
- Chart rendering (multiple timeframes)
- Competition scoring

**Workflow:**
```
Desktop: Research optimization patterns
Claude Code: Implement with performance considerations
✅ CHECKPOINT: Review query plans, indexing strategy
You: "Show me the database query and explain the performance"
Claude Code: Explains + shows EXPLAIN ANALYZE
You: "Add covering index for [columns]"
✅ CHECKPOINT: Benchmark with realistic data volume
```

**Why:** Performance issues don't appear until scale

---

### **3. Complex Integrations** 🔌

**Areas:**
- Gemini 2.0 API (AI parsing)
- Agora.io (live streaming)
- Stripe (payments)
- Supabase Realtime (subscriptions)
- TradingView Charting Library

**Workflow:**
```
Desktop:
- Search docs for existing integration examples
- Research via Exa for production patterns
- Decompose integration into steps

Claude Code: Implement step-by-step
✅ CHECKPOINT after each integration layer:
  1. API client setup
  2. Error handling
  3. Edge cases (timeouts, failures, retries)
  4. Testing with mocks
  5. Testing with real API (if possible)
```

**Why:** Third-party APIs have undocumented quirks

---

### **4. Database Migrations** 🗄️

**Areas:**
- Schema changes
- Data migrations
- RLS policy updates
- Index additions

**Workflow:**
```
Desktop: Plan migration strategy, rollback plan

Claude Code: Generate migration
✅ MANDATORY CHECKPOINT: Review migration SQL
You: Verify:
  - No data loss potential
  - Reversible (down migration)
  - Handles existing data
  - Doesn't lock tables for long

Claude Code: Adjust migration
✅ CHECKPOINT: Test on local DB first
✅ CHECKPOINT: Backup strategy confirmed
Then: Apply to production
```

**Why:** Database mistakes are hard to undo

---

### **5. State Management (Complex UI)** 🎨

**Areas:**
- /live page (12+ synchronized elements)
- Real-time leaderboard
- Multi-timeframe charts
- Competition countdown timers

**Workflow:**
```
Desktop:
- Search docs for similar state patterns
- Decompose state update flows
- Identify atom structure (Jotai)

Claude Code: Implement state management
✅ CHECKPOINT: Review atom structure
You: "Show me the atom dependencies and update flow"
Claude Code: Explains data flow
You: "This could cause infinite re-renders when [scenario]"
Claude Code: Fixes with proper dependencies
✅ CHECKPOINT: Test re-render count
```

**Why:** State bugs cause subtle UI issues and performance problems

---

## 📋 Checkpoint Best Practices

### **Effective Checkpoints**

**Good Checkpoint (Catches Issues):**
```
You: "Show me the API route you created for signal editing.
     Explain how it handles permissions and what happens if
     the signal was already hit/missed."

Claude Code: [Shows code + explanation]

You: "I see you check if user owns the signal, but what if
     someone tries to edit during the brief moment between
     posting and the AI parsing completing?"

Claude Code: "Good catch! Adding status check to prevent
     editing during parsing state."
```

**Poor Checkpoint (Misses Issues):**
```
You: "Looks good, commit it"
[Later discovers race condition in production]
```

### **Checkpoint Questions to Ask**

**For Any Feature:**
- What edge cases did you handle?
- What happens if [external service] is down?
- How does this handle errors?
- What if user does [unexpected action]?
- Are there race conditions?

**For Database Code:**
- Is this query optimized for 10K+ rows?
- What indexes support this?
- Can this cause locks?
- Is there a migration rollback?

**For Frontend:**
- What loading states exist?
- How are errors shown to users?
- What happens on slow connections?
- Is this accessible (a11y)?

**For Integration:**
- What if the API times out?
- How do we retry?
- What's the rate limit?
- How do we test without real API calls?
