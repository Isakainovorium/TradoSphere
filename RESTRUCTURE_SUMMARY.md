- Created `assets/images/` for static assets

### Phase 2: File Migration ✅
**Moved 40+ documentation files to organized structure:**
- **Architecture (8 files)** → `docs/01-architecture/`
- **Development (8 files)** → `docs/02-development/`
- **Features (7 files)** → `docs/03-features/`
- **Business (5 files)** → `docs/04-business/`
- **Testing (1 file)** → `docs/05-testing/`
- **Config (2 files)** → `docs/06-config/`
- **Reference (5 files)** → `docs/07-reference/`
- **Tools (13 files)** → `docs/08-tools/`

### Phase 3: Duplicate Removal ✅
- Removed entire `TradoSphere/` duplicate folder (23 duplicate files)
- Cleaned root directory of scattered documentation

### Phase 4: Asset Organization ✅
- Moved logo to `assets/images/TradoSphere_logo.png`
- Organized static assets in dedicated folder

### Phase 5: Documentation Hub ✅
- Created `docs/README.md` as central navigation
- Updated `DOC_INDEX.md` with all new paths
- All document identifiers preserved and updated

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before
- 82 markdown files scattered across:
  - Root directory (30+ files)
  - `TradoSphere/` folder (23 duplicates)
  - `tools/mcp-servers/` (29 files)
- No clear organization
- Inconsistent naming
- Hard to navigate

### After
- All 82 documents organized in `docs/` with:
  - **00-quick-start/** - Getting started guides
  - **01-architecture/** - Technical architecture (8 docs)
  - **02-development/** - Development guides (8 docs)
  - **03-features/** - Feature specs (7 docs)
  - **04-business/** - Business docs (5 docs)
  - **05-testing/** - Testing (1 doc)
  - **06-config/** - Configuration (2 docs)
  - **07-reference/** - Reference materials (5 docs)
  - **08-tools/** - Tool docs (13 docs)
- Zero duplicates
- Consistent numbered naming
- Clear navigation structure
- Document identifiers (DOC-ARCH-001, etc.) maintained

## 🎯 Key Achievements

1. **Clean Root Directory**
   - Only essential files remain (README, LICENSE, configs)
   - All documentation in `docs/`

2. **Numbered Categories**
   - Easy to find documents (00-08 numbering)
   - Logical grouping by purpose

3. **Document Identifiers**
   - All 82 documents have unique IDs
   - Easy reference system maintained

4. **Documentation Hub**
   - `docs/README.md` provides navigation
   - Quick links to most common documents

5. **Maintained Structure**
   - Application code unchanged (`apps/`, `packages/`)
   - Tools remain in `tools/`
   - Only documentation reorganized
