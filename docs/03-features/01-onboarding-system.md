# **TradoSphere Feature Brief: AI-Assisted Onboarding System**

Date: October 17, 2025  
Parent Document: TradoSphere: Final Feature Brief & Project Synopsis  
Status: Finalized

## **1\. Project Vision & Core Concept**

The first moments on a new platform are critical. Our onboarding process will be an immersive, encouraging, and intelligent experience designed to maximize user understanding and drive engagement from day one. We will introduce **"Sphirie," our Gemini-powered onboarding assistant**, who will act as a personal guide for every new user.

Sphirie's primary goal is to provide a **tier-aware tutorial**, showcasing the full power of the features available to the user based on their specific subscription level. The experience will be framed as a guided tour, culminating in a compelling preview of the premium features that await, creating a natural and effective upsell funnel.

## **2\. Core Mechanics & Technical Implementation**

* **Trigger:** The onboarding sequence will automatically initiate upon the user's first login. A welcome modal will appear, giving the user the option to "Start Tour" or "Explore on My Own." The tour can be restarted at any time from the Settings Hub.  
* **Gemini Integration:** Sphirie's dialogue (the script) will be powered by Gemini, ensuring a friendly, clear, and encouraging tone.  
* **Tier-Aware Logic:** The backend will serve a tutorial "script" based on the user's account tier.  
* **User Progress:** The user's progress through the tour will be saved, allowing them to exit and resume where they left off.
