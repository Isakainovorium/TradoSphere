# TradoSphere: Development Workflow & Git Strategy
*Ironclad Process to Prevent Drift & Maintain Velocity*

## 🎯 Workflow Philosophy

**Goals:**
1. **Consistency**: Every feature follows the same development process
2. **Quality**: No untested code reaches production
3. **Traceability**: Every change linked to a feature/bug ticket
4. **Velocity**: Process enables speed, doesn't hinder it
5. **Solo-Optimized**: Lightweight enough for one developer, scalable for teams

## 🌳 Git Branching Strategy

### Branch Structure

```
main                    # Production (always deployable)
├── develop            # Staging (integration branch)
│   ├── feature/...   # New features
│   ├── fix/...       # Bug fixes
│   ├── refactor/...  # Code improvements
│   ├── docs/...      # Documentation
│   └── chore/...     # Tooling, dependencies
├── hotfix/...        # Emergency production fixes
└── release/...       # Release preparation (optional)
```

### Branch Naming Convention

```bash
# Features (new functionality)
feature/signal-ai-parsing
feature/competition-engine
feature/live-streaming

# Bug fixes
fix/signal-card-render-issue
fix/leaderboard-race-condition

# Refactoring
refactor/extract-signal-service
refactor/optimize-feed-query

# Documentation
docs/add-api-reference
docs/update-deployment-guide

# Chores (tooling, dependencies)
chore/upgrade-next-14.2
chore/add-playwright-tests
```

### Branch Lifecycle

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/signal-ai-parsing

# 2. Make commits (following commit convention)
git add .
git commit -m "feat(signals): add Gemini API integration for level parsing"

# 3. Push to remote
git push origin feature/signal-ai-parsing

# 4. Open Pull Request to develop
# (Use GitHub PR template)

# 5. After PR approved and merged
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git branch -d feature/signal-ai-parsing

# 6. Delete remote branch (auto-deleted after merge)
```

## 🔍 Code Review Guidelines (Solo Developer)

### Self-Review Process

**Before Opening PR:**
1. **Read your own code**: Line by line, as if reviewing someone else's
2. **Run all tests locally**: `pnpm test`
3. **Check TypeScript**: `pnpm type-check`
4. **Lint code**: `pnpm lint`
5. **Test in browser**: Manual QA of changes
6. **Review git diff**: `git diff develop` to see all changes

**After Opening PR:**
1. Wait 10 minutes, review again with fresh eyes
2. Check CI results
3. Test deployed preview (Vercel)
4. Verify no unintended changes

### Red Flags to Watch For

```yaml
🚩 Red Flags:
  - PR touches >500 lines (break into smaller PRs)
  - Tests skipped or commented out
  - TypeScript errors suppressed with `@ts-ignore`
  - Console.logs left in code
  - Hardcoded values instead of env variables
  - TODO comments without linked issues
  - Commented-out code blocks
  - Missing error handling
  - Unclear variable names (e.g., `data`, `temp`, `x`)
```

## 📈 Velocity Tracking

### Story Point Estimation

```yaml
1 point:   <2 hours  (e.g., text change, simple bug fix)
2 points:  2-4 hours (e.g., new component, simple feature)
3 points:  4-8 hours (e.g., API endpoint + tests)
5 points:  1-2 days  (e.g., complex feature)
8 points:  2-3 days  (e.g., major feature like signal parsing)
13 points: 3-5 days  (e.g., competition engine)
21 points: 1+ weeks  (e.g., live streaming - break into smaller tasks)

Target Velocity: 18-22 points per sprint
```

  - [ ] No new technologies introduced without ADR
  - [ ] Database schema matches documented schema
  - [ ] API endpoints follow documented structure

Code Quality:
  - [ ] All tests passing
  - [ ] Code coverage >80%
  - [ ] No TypeScript errors
  - [ ] ESLint warnings addressed

Documentation:
  - [ ] ADRs updated for any major decisions
  - [ ] README reflects current state
  - [ ] API documentation up to date
  - [ ] Database migrations documented

Sprint Health:
  - [ ] On track to meet sprint goals
  - [ ] No scope creep
  - [ ] Technical debt logged and prioritized
```

### Monthly Alignment Review

```yaml
Technical Alignment:
  - Review all ADRs for continued relevance
  - Check tech stack versions (security updates)
  - Audit dependencies (remove unused)
  - Verify CI/CD pipeline health

Feature Alignment:
  - Compare built features to original specs
  - Verify tier access controls working
  - Check for undocumented features
  - Validate against 88-feature checklist

Performance Alignment:
  - Run Lighthouse audits
  - Check API response times
  - Review database query performance
  - Test at scale (load testing)
```

## 🚨 Emergency Hotfix Process

### When to Use Hotfix Branch

```yaml
Criteria:
  - Production is broken (500 errors)
  - Security vulnerability discovered
  - Payment processing failing
  - Data loss risk

NOT for:
  - UI bugs (can wait for next sprint)
  - Performance issues (unless critical)
  - Feature requests (never)
```

### Hotfix Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create hotfix branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/fix-payment-webhook-

bug

# 2. Make minimal fix
git commit -m "fix(payments): handle missing webhook signature"

# 3. Test thoroughly
pnpm test
pnpm test:integration

# 4. Push and open PR to main (not develop!)
git push origin hotfix/fix-payment-webhook-bug

# 5. After merge to main, immediately cherry-pick to develop
git checkout develop
git cherry-pick <hotfix-commit-sha>
git push origin develop
```

---

## 📁 Workspace Organization

### Project Structure Hygiene

```yaml
Keep Clean:
  ✅ All files in correct directories
  ✅ No orphaned files
  ✅ No TODO.txt or temp files committed
  ✅ .gitignore prevents junk files
  ✅ node_modules never committed

Weekly Cleanup:
  - Remove unused imports
  - Delete commented code
  - Archive completed docs
  - Update .env.example
```

---

## 🎓 Learning & Documentation

### When to Document

```yaml
Always Document:
  - New architectural decisions (ADR)
  - Complex algorithms (inline comments)
  - Non-obvious TypeScript patterns
  - Workarounds for library bugs
  - Performance optimizations

Sometimes Document:
  - Self-explanatory code (don't over-comment)
  - Standard patterns (if well-known)

Never Document:
  - What the code does (code should be self-documenting)
  - Commit messages in code comments (use git)
```

---

**This workflow is your contract with yourself. Follow it religiously to maintain velocity and prevent drift.**

**Key Insight**: Discipline in process creates freedom in execution. The 10 minutes spent on proper commit messages saves 2 hours of debugging later.
