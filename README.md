### Our Philosophy

Traditional platforms make you juggle multiple tools—one for charts, one for execution, one for learning, one for community. **We consolidated everything.** 

TradoSphere is where beginners learn by watching real traders at every level, developing traders track progress with AI insights, creators monetize their expertise, and elite traders compete in verified tournaments with real stakes.

**This is trading without the BS.**

## 🥊 Competition System - Verified Trades Only

Competition on TradoSphere isn't based on screenshots or manual entries—it's **verified trades pulled directly from your broker API**. This is only available to TS Gladiator and TS Legend tiers.

### How Verified Competitions Work

**1. Connect Your Broker (TS Elite+)**
- Link your Tradovate, Binance, MT4, NinjaTrader, or any of our 9+ supported brokers
- Your trades auto-sync every 5 minutes
- All positions tracked in real-time

**2. Join a Competition (TS Gladiator+)**

**Option A: Browse & Join Existing Tournaments**
- Browse active tournaments
- Check rules: timeframe, asset class, entry fee, prize pool
- Click "Join" - you're auto-enrolled

**Option B: Algorithmic Matchmaking (Auto-Match)**
- Don't have a buddy? No problem.
- Click "Find Match" and our algorithm pairs you with:
  - Similar skill level (win rate, average P/L, experience)
  - Similar tier (Gladiator vs Gladiator, Legend vs Legend)
  - Similar preferences (asset class, timeframe, stakes)
- Get matched in seconds
- Competition starts automatically

**3. Start Trading**
- Trade normally on your broker
- No need to think about the competition - just trade your strategy

**4. Trade Gets Auto-Verified**
- Every trade you execute goes through verification:
  - ✅ Is it within the competition timeframe?
  - ✅ Does it match the asset class rules?
  - ✅ Is it from your connected broker?
- Valid trades automatically update the leaderboard
- No manual entry, no screenshots, no cheating possible

**5. Real-Time Leaderboard**

- Track time remaining
- Monitor your P/L vs. competitors

**6. Automatic Payouts**

- Prizes distributed automatically via Stripe
- Winners announced, trophies awarded

### Competition Types

**Algorithmic Matchmaking (Auto-Match):**  
No buddy to compete with? Click "Find Match" and get paired instantly.

**How It Works:**
- Algorithm analyzes your profile: win rate, avg P/L, trading experience, tier
- Matches you with traders at similar skill levels
- Prioritizes same asset class preferences (futures vs crypto vs forex)
- Similar stake preferences ($25-100, $100-300, $300+)
- Competition starts automatically when match is found

**Matchmaking Criteria:**
- 📊 Win rate within 10% of yours
- 💰 Average P/L per trade similarity
- ⚔️ Same tier (Gladiator vs Gladiator, Legend vs Legend)
- 📈 Preferred assets (futures, forex, crypto)
- 💵 Similar stake comfort level

**Example:** You're a Gladiator with 55% win rate, trade ES futures, prefer $100 stakes → System finds another Gladiator with 50-60% win rate who trades futures and likes $100 battles.

---

**1v1 Battles:**  
Challenge a specific trader OR use matchmaking. Set stakes ($25-$500), duration (1 day to 1 month), and rules (most P/L, win rate, risk-adjusted returns). 

**Prize Distribution:**
- Winner: 80%
- Host: 5%
- Platform: 10%
- Legends Pool: 5%

**Example:** Two traders enter a $100/each 1v1 battle.
- Total pool: $200
- Winner receives: $160 (80%)
- Host receives: $10 (5%)
- Platform fee: $20 (10%)
- Legends Pool: $10 (5%)

**Team Battles:**  
Form squads of 3-10 traders. Compete against other teams. Combined P/L determines winner. Winning team splits their portion using same distribution as tournaments.

**Free-for-All Tournaments:**  
10-250+ traders enter. Leaderboard format. **Top 5 get paid** with the following distribution:

**Prize Distribution:**
- 🥇 Rank 1: **50%** of prize pool
- 🥈 Rank 2: **15%** of prize pool
- 🥉 Rank 3: **5%** of prize pool
- 4️⃣ Rank 4: **5%** of prize pool
- 5️⃣ Rank 5: **5%** of prize pool
- 👤 Host: **5%** of prize pool
- 🏢 Platform: **10%** of prize pool
- 👑 Legends Pool: **5%** of prize pool

**Total Winners Share: 80%** (top 5 traders)  
**Ecosystem Support: 20%** (host + platform + Legends Pool)

**Example:** 50 traders at $50 entry fee.
- Total pool: $2,500
- 🥇 Rank 1: $1,250 (50%)
- 🥈 Rank 2: $375 (15%)
- 🥉 Rank 3: $125 (5%)
- 4️⃣ Rank 4: $125 (5%)
- 5️⃣ Rank 5: $125 (5%)
- 👤 Host: $125 (5%)
- 🏢 Platform: $250 (10%)
- 👑 Legends Pool: $125 (5%)

**Philosophy:** Even Rank 5 wins 2.5x their entry fee. Making top 5 feels rewarding, encouraging more traders to compete.

**Battle Royale (Quarterly):**  
Platform-hosted mega-event. Biggest prizes. Win this to qualify for TS Legend status. Same prize distribution as above.

### Who Can Compete?
